# deepspeech2-en-bg

-- WORK IN PROGRESS --

This is a Python (+ TensorFlow) implementation of an end-to-end deep learning ASR system, following the Deep Speech 2 model (developed by Baidu Research). The system will ideally be able to recognize and transcribe both English and Bulgarian spoken language.

This system is part of my undergraduate final year project.


MORE INFO WILL BE ADDED SOON!
